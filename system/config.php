  description : This class will allow manipulation of configuration content via an OO class. The current plan is 
  to have a javascript 'Settings' tab which will use ajax to manipulate server XML (or other format). Each settings 
  will trigger the appropriate PHP script. Only specific parameters can be passed into the configuration files, obv 
  because they need to read specific character sequences or strings to function! Some settings will be configured by system 
  events as well, esp. to avoid failures in execution.
